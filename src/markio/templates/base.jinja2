    @input
        $name
        $int(0..100)

Answer Key (c)
--------------

    int main() {
        // reference solution (C)
        printf("Hello World\n!");
        return 0;
    }

Answer Key (python)
--------------------

    # Reference solution in Python 3
    print('Hello World!')


TLE Solution (c)
----------------

    main() {
        // The time limit exceeded solution defines a robust timeout value by
        // implementing a correct solution with a slow algorithm. The timeout
        // will be set as the runtime of the TLE solution.
        //
        // This section is optional and overrides any given timeout parameter
        // defined after the question title.
    }


Placeholder
-----------

    An optional placeholder comment. In most cases this is converted as a
    block of comments in the desired computer language.

Placeholder (python3)
---------------------

    # You can also specify a per-language placeholder.
